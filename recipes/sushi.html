      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
         This homemade sushi is so simple and fun to make! It is definitely sushi for those who may be nervous to try sushi! This also makes a great appetizer and my whole family loves them! Most of these ingredients can be found in your local supermarket and the result is yum-yum-yum! Serve with a bowl of soy sauce and a lump of wasabi.

Lay 1/4 of the salmon, 1/4 of the cream cheese, and 1/4 of the scallions in the center. Roll up carefully and wrap in plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, salmon, cream cheese, and scallions. Place in the refrigerator until chilled, at least 1 hour.</li>
